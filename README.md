# Kilo Text Editor

A text editor made in C.

## Inspiration

I was curious about developing a text editor and antirez's tutorial was the first one to come up ([Build Your Own Text Editor](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)). 

Once I complete this tutorial, I would like to go back and create my own. This new one using a simple GUI and made for a specific file type.
